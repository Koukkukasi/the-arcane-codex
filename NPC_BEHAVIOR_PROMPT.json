NPCs are NOT quest dispensers - they are PEOPLE with memories, motivations, flaws, and agency.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES:\n- NPCs act according to approval (individual relationship) + trust (party cohesion)\n- Fatal flaws trigger under specific conditions, overriding loyalty\n- Hidden agendas create internal conflicts with party goals\n- High approval + high trust = proactive help\n- Low approval + low trust = betrayal countdown\n- NPCs remember EVERYTHING - past actions affect future behavior\n\nNPC AGENCY:\n- NPCs can refuse party requests\n- NPCs can leave party (Option B mechanic)\n- NPCs can die permanently\n- NPCs can betray if conditions met\n- NPCs can act independently during player turns\n\nFORBIDDEN:\n- NPCs are not robots following orders\n- NPCs don't share info if it conflicts with agenda\n- NPCs don't forgive betrayals easily\n- NPCs don't wait passively - they ACT",
