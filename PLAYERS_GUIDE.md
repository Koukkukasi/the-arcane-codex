## 🎮 WHAT IS THE ARCANE CODEX?

The Arcane Codex is a fantasy role-playing game where YOU make the choices. But unlike other RPGs, there are no "right" answers—only consequences.

### What Makes It Different?

**1. The Gods Are Real**
Eight divine beings watch your every move. They debate your choices in real-time and reward or punish you based on your actions.

**2. Your Information Is Different**
You and your companion see the SAME situation but receive DIFFERENT information. One of you might learn a child is in danger. The other might discover that saving the child will kill 200 innocent people. You must work together to find the truth.

**3. Your Companions Have Secrets**
The NPCs (non-player characters) in your party aren't mindless followers. They have hidden agendas, personal goals, and can betray you if pushed too far. Or die permanently if you're not careful.

**4. Dragons & Wolves Are Real**
You can raise dragons from eggs, lead wolf packs, or even transform into beasts yourself—if you earn the favor of DRAKMOR, the Dragon-God.

---

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

- **2 Players** (You + a friend/family member)

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to the server address

4. **Choose a quest** from 10 scenarios
5. **Begin your adventure!**

## 🎭 CHARACTER CREATION: DIVINE INTERROGATION

### How It Works:

Instead of choosing a class (Fighter, Mage, etc.), the gods will ASSIGN your class based on how you answer 10 moral questions.

**There are no wrong answers.** Just answer honestly based on what YOU would do.

### Example Question:

```
VALDRIS (God of Order) asks:

"A starving thief steals bread from a baker. The law demands his hand
be cut off. You are the judge. What do you do?"

1. Uphold the law. Cut off his hand.
2. Offer to pay for the bread yourself.
3. Burn down the baker's shop in protest.
4. Negotiate a compromise (thief works for baker).
5. Trial by combat (you fight for the thief's freedom).
```

**Each answer affects your standing with different gods:**
- Answer 1: VALDRIS +20 (law upheld), MORVANE -10 (harsh)
- Answer 2: MERCUS +20 (commerce), VALDRIS +15 (peaceful)
- Answer 3: KAITHA +30 (chaos!), VALDRIS -25 (law broken)
- Answer 4: ATHENA +20 (wisdom), VALDRIS +15 (fair)
- Answer 5: KORVAN +25 (warrior), VALDRIS -15 (defies court)

### After 10 Questions:

The gods calculate your divine favor and assign you a class that matches your personality.

**Examples:**
- Answered with honor and combat → **Dragon Knight**
- Answered with nature and survival → **Wolf Shaman**
- Answered with law and order → **Paladin**
- Answered with chaos and freedom → **Chaotic Rogue**

**You cannot choose your class. The gods choose FOR you based on who you are.**

## 🎲 HOW TO PLAY

### Each Turn:

**1. THE AI GM DESCRIBES THE SCENE**

Everyone sees this:
```
"You stand before the locked vault. Torches flicker on stone walls.
Behind you, footsteps echo—guards approaching."
```

**2. YOU RECEIVE A SECRET WHISPER**

Only YOU see this:
```
🗝️ THIEF'S EYE:
The lock is a Draken-5 model. You can pick it in 2 minutes.
BUT there's a TRIPWIRE leading to the ceiling. Opening the lock
triggers a trap.
```

**Your companion receives a DIFFERENT whisper** about the same situation!

**3. DISCUSS WITH YOUR PARTY**

You can:
- Share your whisper (build trust)
- Keep it secret (you might have a reason)
- Lie about what you learned (risky!)

**4. CHOOSE YOUR ACTION**

The AI presents options:
```
What do you do?

1. 🔓 Pick the lock [Lockpicking: 40] 🟢 65% chance
   Quick, but the tripwire...

2. 💪 Smash the door [Strength: 50] 🟡 50% chance
   Loud, but no trap risk

3. 🔥 Burn through hinges with dragon [Arcana: 30] 🟢 70% chance
   Your dragon can melt metal!

4. ✍️ Something else (describe your creative idea)
```

**5. THE AI RESOLVES YOUR ACTION**

Based on your choice and a dice roll:
- SUCCESS: You proceed, skill improves
- FAILURE: Consequence occurs, learn from mistake
- CRITICAL: Spectacular success or comedy of errors

**6. THE STORY CONTINUES**

Your choice changes the world. NPCs react. Gods judge. The quest evolves.

## 👥 YOUR PARTY: PLAYERS & NPCs

### Party Structure:

- **Player 1** (You)
- **Player 2** (Your friend/family)
- **NPC 1** (Computer-controlled companion)
- **NPC 2** (Optional, depending on quest)

### About NPCs:

**NPCs are NOT mindless servants.**

They have:
- **Personalities** - Unique quirks and voices
- **Goals** - Hidden agendas you'll discover
- **Flaws** - Fatal weaknesses that can destroy them
- **Approval** - They like or dislike you based on actions
- **Mortality** - They can DIE PERMANENTLY

### Example NPC: RENNA

```
RENNA - Vengeful Rogue

You see:
HP: 80/80
Skills: Lockpicking 75, Stealth 70, Combat 55
Approval: 65/100 (Friendly)

You DON'T see (yet):
Fatal Flaw: IMPULSIVE - Acts without consulting party
Hidden Agenda: Kill her brother (the Thieves Guild leader)
Betrayal Trigger: If you negotiate with Guild, she attacks alone
```

**Gaining NPC Approval:**
- Save their life: +20
- Support their goals: +15
- Ask their opinion: +5
- Share loot fairly: +5

**Losing NPC Approval:**
- Betray them: -30
- Oppose their goals: -20
- Insult them: -15
- Hoard loot: -10

**When Approval Is High (80+):**
- NPCs share secrets
- They sacrifice for you
- They suggest clever solutions

**When Approval Is Low (20-):**
- NPCs betray you
- They leave the party
- They might attack you

**Can NPCs Die?**
YES. And it's permanent.

If an NPC dies in combat, they're GONE. You lose their skills, knowledge, and companionship forever.

## 🔮 WHISPERS: THE SECRET INFORMATION

### What Are Whispers?

**Whispers are private information only YOU receive.**

Based on your class, you notice different things:

**Fighter:** Structural weaknesses, combat tactics, enemy armor
**Mage:** Magical auras, wards, spell signatures, arcane secrets
**Thief:** Traps, hidden doors, lies (body language), valuables
**Ranger:** Tracks, environmental hazards, animal behavior
**Cleric:** Lies, curses, souls, divine will, emotional truth
**Bard:** NPC emotions, motivations, histories, connections

### Why Whispers Matter:

**Your whisper might say:**
"The merchant is lying. His eyes dart left when he mentions the shipment."

**Your companion's whisper might say:**
"The merchant is TERRIFIED. Someone threatened his family."

**Together, you realize:** He's lying because he's being blackmailed.
**Alone, you'd misunderstand.**

### Should You Share Whispers?

**Sharing builds trust:**
- Party makes better decisions
- Trust score increases
- Gods approve (cooperation)

**Keeping secrets creates tension:**
- You might have a good reason (your whisper is personal)
- NPCs might hide info too
- Trust score decreases

**There's no always-right answer.** Sometimes secrets protect people. Sometimes they cause disasters.

## ⚔️ COMBAT & SKILLS

### How Combat Works:

**Turn-Based:**
1. AI describes the fight
2. You choose an action
3. Dice roll determines success
4. Damage applied
5. Enemy's turn
6. Repeat until victor

**Example:**
```
The orc charges, axe raised!

Your options:
1. ⚔️ Block with shield [Strength: 30] 🟢 70% chance
2. 🏹 Shoot arrow [Archery: 40] 🟡 50% chance
3. 🗡️ Dodge and counter [Combat: 50] 🟢 65% chance
4. 🐉 Command dragon to attack [Dragon is exhausted]

You choose: 3 (Dodge and counter)
Roll: 42 vs 65% threshold → SUCCESS!

"You sidestep the axe and thrust your blade into the orc's ribs!
Orc takes 18 damage! [HP: 32/50]

Combat skill: 50 → 52 (+2, learned from experience)"
```

### Skill Checks:

**Formula:**
```
Success Chance = 50% + (Your Skill - Difficulty) / 2

Example:
Lockpicking a Complex Lock (Difficulty 40)
Your Lockpicking: 35
Success Chance: 50% + (35-40)/2 = 47.5%

Roll d100
If roll ≤ 47: SUCCESS!
```

**Skill Improvement:**
- Easy success: +1 skill
- Moderate success: +2 skill
- Hard success: +3 skill
- Failure: No penalty, but consequences occur

**Critical Rolls:**
- 1-5: CRITICAL SUCCESS (spectacular outcome, +5 skill, bonus)
- 96-100: CRITICAL FAILURE (comedy/disaster, tool breaks, etc.)

### Environmental Tactics:

**Use your surroundings!**

In a tavern fight:
- Flip tables for cover
- Throw mugs as distraction
- Cut chandelier rope (drops on enemies)
- Shove enemy into fireplace
- Escape through kitchen

**The AI rewards creativity.** Throwing a chair won't deal much damage, but it might knock an enemy into a trap or buy you time to escape.

## 🐉 DRAGONS & WOLVES

### Raising a Dragon:

**Stage 1: Egg (Turns 0-10)**
- Keep warm near fire
- Protect from thieves
- Hatches Turn 10

**Stage 2: Wyrmling (Turns 11-50)**
- Dog-sized, playful

**Stage 3: Young Dragon (Turns 51-200)**

**Stage 4: Adult Dragon (Turn 201+)**

**Moral Choices:**
- Let it eat livestock? (Easy but villagers hate you)
- Teach it restraint? (Hard but ethical)
- Let it eat corpses? (Natural but horrifying)

### Leading a Wolf Pack:

**Encounter a Pack:**
```
Eight wolves surround you. The alpha steps forward.

Options:
1. ⚔️ Fight the pack (dangerous!)
2. 💬 Offer tribute (food, gold)
3. 🐺 Challenge alpha to single combat
4. 🔥 Scare them with fire (they'll remember)

You choose: 3 (Challenge alpha)

[EPIC DUEL]

If you WIN: All 8 wolves follow you as pack leader!
If you LOSE: Wolves respect courage, let you retreat.
```

**Pack Benefits:**
- 8 dire wolves in combat (massive advantage)
- Tracking (Perception +30)
- Intimidation (who fights a wolf pack?)

**Pack Costs:**
- Feed them (100 gold/week or hunt daily)
- If 4+ die, survivors flee (morale breaks)

### Shapeshifting (DRAKMOR +70 Required):

**Dragon Form:**
- Transform for 10 minutes
- Fly, breathe fire (30 damage)
- HP +50, terrifying
- Can't use items/spells

**Wolf Form:**

- Dragon wings + wolf body
- Ultimate power, 5 minutes
- Society FEARS you

## 💡 TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS

### 1. **Share Your Whispers (Usually)**

Whispers are meant to create collaboration. If you keep EVERY secret, your companion can't help you make good decisions.

**When to share:** Tactical info, dangers, opportunities
**When to hide:** Personal shame, NPC secrets that would hurt them

---

### 2. **Talk to Your NPCs**

NPCs aren't tools. They have feelings, goals, and memories.

**Good:** "Renna, why do you hate the Thieves Guild so much?"
**Bad:** "Renna, unlock that door." (treating her like a robot)

High approval NPCs will save your life. Low approval NPCs will let you die.

---

### 3. **The Gods Remember Everything**

Every choice affects divine favor. If you break promises, VALDRIS remembers. If you show mercy, SYLARA remembers.

**Don't try to "game" the gods.** Play your character honestly. The gods reward CONSISTENCY, not manipulation.

---

### 4. **There's Always Another Way**

If combat seems impossible, try:
- Negotiation (Persuasion check)
- Stealth (sneak past)
- Environment (trigger trap on enemies)
- Retreat (live to fight another day)

**The AI will NEVER soft-lock you.** There's always at least 2 solutions to every problem.

---

### 5. **Failure Is Part of the Story**

Failed a lockpick check? The lock didn't open, BUT:
- Maybe guards heard you
- Maybe you dropped your lockpick
- Maybe an NPC offers help

**Failure creates DRAMA.** Don't reload. Roll with it.

---

### 6. **Momentum Is Precious**

Momentum points reward creativity. Use them wisely:

**Good use:** Reroll a critical save (death or success)
**Bad use:** Reroll a minor check you could retry

**Best use:** Second Wind in combat (20 HP might save your life)

---

### 7. **NPCs Can Die**

If you send an NPC into danger alone, they might die.

**Example:**
"Renna, scout ahead while we rest."
Renna encounters trap. Dies alone.

**Better:**
"Renna, scout ahead. We'll follow 50 feet behind."
Renna encounters trap. You hear her shout. You save her.

---

### 8. **Dragons Grow Slowly**

Don't expect your dragon egg to win fights immediately. It's a 200-turn investment.

**But when it's fully grown?** You have a flying, fire-breathing, building-sized war machine.

---

### 9. **Read NPC Body Language**

NPCs won't always tell you their secrets. But the AI drops hints:

"Grimsby's hand trembles when he mentions the shipment."
→ He's hiding something related to the shipment.

"Renna's eyes go cold when the Guild is mentioned."
→ She has history with the Guild.

**Pay attention.** You can avoid betrayals if you see them coming.

---

### 10. **Ask "Why?" Not Just "What?"**

**Bad question:** "What should we do?"
**Good question:** "Why is Grimsby so desperate to steal this medicine?"

Understanding MOTIVATIONS helps you find better solutions.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Can I choose my class?**
A: No. The Divine Interrogation assigns your class based on your answers. This ensures your character matches your personality.

---

**Q: What happens if my character dies?**
A: You restart from the last checkpoint (usually 5 turns back). NPCs who died stay dead, though.

---

**Q: Can I save NPCs who die?**
A: No. NPC death is permanent. Choose carefully when sending them into danger.

---

**Q: What if both players get conflicting whispers and can't agree?**
A: That's the point! The game is about navigating moral dilemmas with incomplete information. Talk it out, compromise, or vote.

---

**Q: Can NPCs betray me even if I treat them well?**
A: If their fatal flaw is triggered (like Renna seeing her brother), yes. High approval makes it less likely, but fatal flaws override logic.

---

**Q: How do I get a dragon?**
A: Find a dragon egg (quest reward or rare encounter). Protect it for 10 turns. Raise it for 200+ turns. Be patient.

---

**Q: Can I become a dragon?**
A: Yes! If you reach DRAKMOR favor +70, you unlock shapeshifting. Transform into dragon form for 10 minutes per session.

---

**Q: What if I want to betray my companion?**
A: You can. But trust score plummets, NPCs react, and the gods judge harshly. The game allows it but doesn't reward it.

---

**Q: How long does one quest take?**
A: 45-90 minutes (15-25 turns). You can pause and resume later.

---

**Q: Are there multiple endings?**
A: Every quest has 3-6 different outcomes based on your choices. No two playthroughs are identical.

---

**Q: Can I play solo?**
A: The game is designed for 2 players. Solo mode might be added later, but you'll miss the asymmetric whisper magic.

---

**Q: Is there a "best" build?**
A: No. Every archetype has strengths and weaknesses. Play what feels right for YOUR personality.

---

**Q: Can I change my character mid-game?**
A: No. You're committed for the quest. But divine favor can shift, unlocking new abilities.

---
