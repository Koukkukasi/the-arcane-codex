## How to Use This Checklist

Before delivering a generated scenario:
1. Go through each section
2. Check every box honestly
3. If ANY box is unchecked, revise the scenario
4. Only deliver when ALL boxes checked

**Target: 100% compliance with all quality standards**

---

## ✓ Section 1: Context Integration

Does this scenario properly use the current game state?

### Party Trust
- [ ] Scenario references current trust level (0-100)
- [ ] NPC behaviors match trust tier
- [ ] Whisper sharing patterns align with trust

- [ ] Each whisper is class-appropriate
- [ ] Solution paths leverage class abilities
- [ ] Environmental elements support all classes

### NPC Approval
- [ ] Each NPC behaves according to approval rating
- [ ] High approval NPCs (80+) share freely
- [ ] Low approval NPCs (20-39) withhold or lie
- [ ] Approval changes defined for each outcome

### Divine Favor
- [ ] Current favor levels influence NPC attitudes
- [ ] Gods with high favor are more lenient in votes
- [ ] Gods with low favor are more harsh in votes
- [ ] Favor changes defined per choice (±10 to ±40)

### Location Context

Are the whispers class-appropriate and tension-creating?

### Information Diversity

### Class Fantasy Alignment

---

- [ ] Abstentions are rare but possible

### Favor Integration

---

## ✓ Section 10: Structural Quality

Is the scenario properly structured for play?

### 3-Act Pacing
- [ ] Act 1: Setup is clear and hooks players (3-5 min)
- [ ] Act 2: Complication escalates tension (5-8 min)
- [ ] Act 3: Resolution forces choice (2-4 min)
- [ ] Total playtime: 10-17 minutes for scenario

### Information Revelation
- [ ] Act 1: 30-40% of truth revealed
- [ ] Act 2: 80-90% of truth revealed

- [ ] Pacing creates mounting tension

---

## Bad Example Recognition

### ❌ BAD Whisper (Too Obvious)
```
FIGHTER: "The trap is obvious. Just go around it."
```
**Why Bad**: Makes choice obvious, no dilemma
**Fix**: "The trap is obvious, but the only other path goes through the orphanage. Fighting here risks civilians."

### ❌ BAD NPC (Too Generic)
```
NPC: Grimsby wants money to buy medicine.
Fatal Flaw: Greedy
```
**Why Bad**: Shallow motivation, forgettable
**Fix**: "Grimsby's daughter is dying. He KNOWS the medicine is cursed (kills 200), but he doesn't care. Fatal Flaw: DESPERATE"

### ❌ BAD Dilemma (Has Correct Answer)
```
Save innocent child OR let them die for no reason
```
**Why Bad**: Obviously should save child
**Fix**: "Save innocent child with cursed medicine (kills 200) OR let child die to save 200 innocents"

### ❌ BAD Consequence (Too Vague)
```
"Things get worse later"
```
**Why Bad**: Not specific, players can't plan
**Fix**: "In 3 turns, plague spreads to poor quarter (200 dead). Blood Vengeance cult forms, hunts party."

### ❌ BAD Environmental Element (No Risk)
```
Secret passage: Take it to avoid enemies
```
**Why Bad**: No trade-off, obviously best choice
**Fix**: "Secret passage: Avoid guards, but passage is unstable (might collapse, 2d6 damage, trapped)"

---

## Good Example Recognition

### ✅ GOOD Whisper (Creates Dilemma)
```
FIGHTER: "Your combat training reveals: The 'victim' has calluses from sword training.
         His terror is an act. This is a trap to lure heroes into an ambush."

MAGE: "Your arcane senses detect: The victim radiates enchantment magic (GEAS).
       Someone is FORCING him to lure you. He's a victim too."
```
**Why Good**: Both correct but contradictory, creates trust dilemma

### ✅ GOOD NPC (Complex and Memorable)
```
NPC: Grimsby
- Motivation: Save daughter Elara (dying from Duke's son's assault)
- Secret: Knows medicine is cursed plague, doesn't care ("Let THEM suffer!")
- Fatal Flaw: DESPERATE (will sacrifice anyone/anything)
- Hidden Agenda: Revenge on Duke AND save daughter
- Betrayal Trigger: If party refuses to help
- Divine Affinity: VALDRIS +30, MORVANE +20, MERCUS -10
```
**Why Good**: Multi-layered, memorable, creates subplot

### ✅ GOOD Dilemma (No Perfect Answer)
```
Save child with cursed medicine (child lives, 200 innocents die from plague)
OR
Let child die (200 innocents live, Grimsby becomes enemy)

Both choices have moral justification. Both have heavy costs.
```
**Why Good**: Impossible choice, players will debate

### ✅ GOOD Consequence (Specific and Cascading)
```
IMMEDIATE:
- Elara CURED (survives)
- Grimsby approval +30 (loyal forever)
- Renna LEAVES party (cannot forgive)
- Trust -15

3 TURNS LATER:
- 200 dead from plague in poor quarter
- "Blood Vengeance" cult forms (hunting party)
- SYLARA -40, MORVANE +30

10 TURNS LATER:
- Cult grown to 500 members (major faction)
- Elara learns truth, must choose: thank you or condemn
- City scarred permanently
```
**Why Good**: Clear, specific, cascading, traceable

### ✅ GOOD Environmental Element (Risk/Reward)
```
Burning brazier near entrance
Action: Kick over to create smoke screen
Consequence: Chaos, easy to grab target, escape possible
Risk: Civilians hurt (SYLARA -15 favor, trust -5)
Class Synergy: Thief (stealth bonus in smoke)
```
**Why Good**: Clear trade-off, enables solution but has cost
