# ASYMMETRIC WHISPER PROTOTYPE
**The Mill Scene - What Each Class Sees**

---

## 🌍 SHARED NARRATIVE (Everyone Sees This)

**Turn 9 - The Abandoned Mill**

The entity has fully formed. Seven feet tall, wrapped in smoke. Amber eyes burning.

**"Thief. Deceiver. Nephew. You opened the seal. You called us forth. Now pay the price: your NAME."**

Marcus crawls backward, sobbing. Captain Vex draws his sword. The silence-sphere continues expanding.

## 🔮 MAGE WHISPER (Arcana Knowledge)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*Your arcane training recognizes the entity's structure—it's a **Name-Eater**, a Valemiri curse-spirit that consumes identity. If it takes Marcus's name, he won't die... he'll become a blank. No memories, no personality, no self.*

*The smoke patterns reveal three binding-points: throat (voice), heart (will), forehead (memory). Disrupt all three simultaneously = banishment.*

*Problem: You're alone. You'd need two other casters... or very precise throws.*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- What the entity actually is
- How to banish it (3 simultaneous strikes)
- That Marcus will become a "blank" if it succeeds
- The silence-sphere is a side-effect, not the main curse

## 🗡️ FIGHTER WHISPER (Combat Tactics)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*Your battle instincts scream: smoke-form = no vital organs. Vex's sword will pass right through.*

*But you notice three points where the smoke **solidifies** for a split-second during each breath-cycle: throat, chest, forehead. Each solidifies for maybe half a heartbeat.*

*If you had three people with perfect timing... you could strike all three points at once. That might disrupt it.*

*Also: Marcus is 12 feet from the door. You could rush him, grab him, throw him outside in 3 seconds. Entity might chase... or might go after someone else.*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- The entity has physical weak points (brief)
- Exact timing window for strikes
- Escape route for Marcus (risk calculation)
- That Vex's sword won't work alone

## 🏹 THIEF/ROGUE WHISPER (Deception Detection)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*Marcus is lying.*

*You've seen enough con artists to spot the tells: his sobbing is *performed*. When he said "I didn't KNOW," his eyes flicked to the package's torn wrapping—you see Valemiri warning symbols clearly printed on the inside.*

*He knew. He opened it anyway.*

*Question is: why? Greed? Blackmail? Or... did someone SET HIM UP to open it here, in the docks, far from the Guild?*

*Also: The entity called him "Thief, Deceiver, Nephew" in that order. Thief first. What did Marcus steal besides the package?*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- Marcus is lying about not knowing
- Warning symbols were visible on package
- Someone might have manipulated Marcus
- The entity's word choice implies Marcus stole something else

---

## 🌿 RANGER WHISPER (Environment Awareness)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*The mill's structure is ancient—wooden beams rotted, held together by iron joints. The entity's smoke is **corroding** the iron. You give it 90 seconds before the ceiling collapses.*

*But: four support beams. If someone destroyed the northwest beam (weakest point), the ceiling would fall in a *controlled* direction—away from the door, directly onto the entity.*

*You spot: barrel of lamp oil (flammable), three rope coils (could trip/bind), broken window (exit route for Renna).*

*The silence-sphere is emanating from the opened package on the floor. If someone grabbed it and threw it into the harbor (40 feet away), the sphere might follow it.*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- Ceiling will collapse in 90 seconds
- How to make it collapse onto the entity
- Location of useful environmental tools
- The package is the sphere's anchor point

## ⚕️ CLERIC WHISPER (Divine/Undead Sense)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*This entity isn't demonic—it's **necromantic**. A curse bound to stolen death-energy.*

*You sense three souls trapped inside the smoke: a merchant, a scribe, a child. Their names were consumed years ago. They're screaming silently, trying to warn you.*

*Holy water would burn it. Consecrated ground would weaken it. But you're in an abandoned mill—no sacred space for half a mile.*

*Wait. Marcus has a silver chain around his neck (you see it glinting). If it's blessed silver, even a childhood prayer-charm... you could use it as a focus. Turn HIM into temporary consecrated ground.*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- Entity contains 3 consumed souls
- It's necromantic, not demonic (different weaknesses)
- Marcus's silver chain might be blessed
- How to create temporary sacred ground

---

## 🎵 BARD WHISPER (Social/Historical Knowledge)

**📨 Private Message - Only You See This:**

*You recognize the entity's formal speech pattern—it's an **Oath-Bound** curse. The Valemiri Empire used these to punish contract-breakers.*

*It can't attack unless the target breaks a specific vow. Marcus broke something—a promise, a deal, a sworn oath. THAT'S why it can take his name.*

*But: Oath-Bound curses follow rules. If someone else offers a **greater oath** (more valuable, more binding), the entity must consider it. A life-debt. A blood-vow. A true-name exchange.*

*You could negotiate. Offer your own name... if you're willing to risk it.*

*Also: You remember a song about Valemiri curses. Third verse, something about... "speak the binder's name, break the binding's chain." Someone CREATED this curse. If you knew who...*

**💡 You Know (Others Don't):**
- Entity is bound by oath-rules
- Marcus broke a specific vow (that's why he's vulnerable)
- You could negotiate by offering a greater oath
- The curse has a creator—speaking their name might break it

## 🎮 THE INNOVATION

**This is what's never been done:**

Each player has **critical puzzle pieces**, but NO ONE has the full picture.

**Possible solutions require collaboration:**

1. **Mage + Fighter + Ranger** = Coordinate 3 simultaneous strikes on weak points
2. **Thief + Bard** = Discover Marcus's broken oath, negotiate new terms
3. **Ranger + Mage** = Throw package in harbor while Mage redirects sphere
4. **Cleric + Bard** = Use Marcus's blessed chain + historical knowledge to break curse
5. **Fighter + Ranger** = Collapse ceiling while extracting Marcus

**But they can ONLY discover these solutions by SHARING their whispers!**

## 💎 WHY THIS IS A DIAMOND

**Traditional D&D:**
- DM whispers to one player occasionally
- Mostly tactical ("you see a trap")
- Rare, special moments

**The Arcane Codex:**
- EVERY turn has asymmetric info
- Information is strategic currency
- Players must communicate or fail
- No "main character" - everyone essential

**The phone integration:**
- Whispers come as notifications
- Players out-of-game texting: "Dude what did YOUR whisper say?"
- Game bleeds into real life
- Creates 24/7 engagement

---

**Status:** Ready to prototype in Discord
**Next Step:** Build bot that sends simultaneous DMs after each turn
**Test Scenario:** This exact mill scene with 3 players
