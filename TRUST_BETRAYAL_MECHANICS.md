# TRUST & BETRAYAL MECHANICS
**The Arcane Codex - Core System**
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-03

---

## 📋 Overview

Trust is the **invisible currency** of The Arcane Codex. Every whisper you share, every secret you keep, and every NPC you believe shapes your party's **Trust Score**.

**Core Concept:** Asymmetric whispers create information asymmetry. Trust mechanics reward collaboration while punishing lies and betrayals.

## 📊 Trust Gain & Loss

### GAINING TRUST (+)

**+15: Share Critical Whisper That Saves Life**
```
Example: Player 2 shares "The bridge is trapped!" whisper before Player 1 crosses.
Result: Party avoids death trap, trust increases significantly.
```

**+10: Share Whisper That Changes Strategy**
```
Example: Player 1 shares "The merchant is terrified, not lying" whisper.
Result: Party adjusts approach, negotiates instead of attacking.
```

**+5: Share Minor Whisper Proactively**
```
Example: "My whisper says the innkeeper seems honest."
Result: Builds transparency habit, small trust gain.
```

**+10: Defend NPC When Others Doubt**
```
Example: Renna wants to attack. Player vouches for her reasoning.
Result: NPC feels supported, trust increases.
```

**+15: Risk Self to Save Companion**
```
Example: Player 1 takes damage to shield wounded NPC.
Result: Actions speak louder than words, major trust gain.
```

**+5: Admit Mistake/Apologize**
```
Example: "I was wrong about the merchant. I'm sorry."
Result: Vulnerability builds trust.
```

---

### LOSING TRUST (-)

**-20: Lie About Whisper Content (When Caught)**
```
Example: Player 1 says "My whisper says nothing" but NPC heard contradiction.
Result: Lying is worse than withholding. Severe penalty.
```

**-15: Hide Critical Whisper That Causes Harm**
```
Example: Player 2 knew bridge was trapped, didn't share, someone injured.
Result: Preventable harm destroys trust.
```

**-10: Keep Secret That Would Change Decision**
```
Example: Player 1 knows merchant is blackmailed, doesn't share, party attacks merchant.
Result: Information asymmetry causes morally wrong choice.
```

**-5: Refuse to Share When Directly Asked**
```
Example: "What did your whisper say?" "None of your business."
Result: Defensiveness breeds suspicion.
```

**-10: Act Against Group Without Explanation**
```
Example: Player 1 attacks NPC the party was negotiating with, no warning.
Result: Unilateral decisions fracture unity.
```

**-15: Betray NPC to Save Self**
```
Example: Party abandons wounded Grimsby to save themselves.
Result: Cowardice is unforgivable.
```

**-25: Deliberately Mislead Party for Personal Gain**
```
Example: Player 1 tells party "vault is empty" but secretly pockets treasure.
Result: Selfishness destroys party cohesion.
```

**-30: Betray Player Character**
```
Example: Player 2 tells guards Player 1's location for reward.
Result: PvP betrayal is catastrophic.
```

## 🤐 The "Good Secret" vs. "Bad Secret" Dilemma

Not all secrets are equal. The game **judges intent**.

### GOOD SECRETS (No penalty or small penalty):

**1. Protecting Feelings**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "Grimsby's daughter is already dead."
Keep Secret: Spare him hope until confirmed (-0 trust, +10 SYLARA compassion)
Share Anyway: Brutal honesty may prepare him (+5 trust, +10 ATHENA wisdom)

Judgment: Both valid. Gods debate. No "wrong" answer.
```

**2. Strategic Withholding**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "Renna's brother is the Guild leader."
Keep Secret: Let Renna reveal when ready (-0 trust, respects NPC privacy)
Share Immediately: Alert party to potential conflict (+5 trust, +10 VALDRIS vigilance)

Judgment: Timing matters. Neither choice catastrophic.
```

**3. Personal Trauma**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "You recognize the slaver who killed your family."
Keep Secret: Deal with emotions privately (-0 trust)
Share: Let party help you process (+10 trust, NPCs offer support)

Judgment: Player choice. Game respects emotional boundaries.
```

---

### BAD SECRETS (Penalties apply):

**1. Life-Threatening Information**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "The water is poisoned."
Keep Secret: Someone drinks, gets poisoned (-15 trust, -20 all gods except MORVANE)
Reason: Preventable harm. Inexcusable.
```

**2. Hidden Betrayal**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "Renna plans to attack the Guild leader tonight."
Keep Secret: Renna goes alone, dies (-15 trust, -20 VALDRIS/KORVAN)
Reason: Could have intervened. Complicity through silence.
```

**3. Selfish Deception**
```
Scenario: Your whisper says "There's a secret exit behind the bookshelf."
Keep Secret: Use exit to escape alone while party fights (-25 trust, -30 all gods except KAITHA)
Reason: Abandonment. Unforgivable.
```

## 🎭 NPC Reactions to Trust Levels

NPCs are **not robots**. They respond to party trust dynamically.

### HIGH TRUST (80-100):

**GRIMSBY (Desperate Father):**
```
At 85 Trust:
- Volunteers: "The guard captain owes me a favor. I can get you inside."
- Reveals: "I was a thief once. I know the Duke's security."
- Sacrifice: If party endangered, throws self at enemy to buy time
```

**RENNA (Vengeful Rogue):**
```
At 90 Trust:
- Shares: "My brother leads the Guild. I need to kill him. Will you help?"
- Listens: If party says "Don't go alone," she actually waits
- Loyalty: Stays even if approval drops, because trust > personal grudge
```

---

### MEDIUM TRUST (40-79):

**GRIMSBY:**
```
At 55 Trust:
- Professional: Follows orders, doesn't volunteer extra info
- Guarded: "I have my reasons" when questioned about past
- Self-Preservation: If combat goes badly, retreats to save self (approval-dependent)
```

**RENNA:**
```
At 60 Trust:
- Functional: Picks locks, scouts, fights effectively
- Secretive: Doesn't mention brother or Guild
- Impulsive: Still acts on fatal flaw when triggered, but warns party first
```

---

### LOW TRUST (10-39):

**GRIMSBY:**
```
At 25 Trust:
- Suspicious: "Why should I tell you? You never tell me anything."
- Lies: Claims not to know guard schedules (actually does)
- Abandonment Risk: At 20 trust, threatens to leave: "I'll find other help."
```

**RENNA:**
```
At 30 Trust:
- Hostile: "You don't trust me? Fine. I don't trust YOU."
- Withholds Skills: Refuses to pick locks, "Do it yourself"
- Betrayal Risk: At 25 trust, may steal from party: "Insurance policy"
```

---

### ZERO TRUST (0-9):

**GRIMSBY:**
```
At 5 Trust:
- Turn 1: "I can't work with people who treat me like a tool."
- Turn 2: Leaves party permanently, takes quest objective (daughter's location)
- Result: Quest becomes exponentially harder without insider knowledge
```

**RENNA:**
```
At 5 Trust:
- Turn 1: "You've been waiting for me to betray you. Fine. I WILL."
- Turn 2: Steals key item (Guild key), attacks party if pursued
- Result: Renna becomes ENEMY. Can be killed or negotiated with (DC 95 Persuasion)
```

## ⚖️ Divine Council & Trust

The 7 gods judge trust differently.

### Gods Who REWARD High Trust:

**VALDRIS (Order/Law) +15**

```

---

### Gods Who DON'T CARE About Trust:

**KAITHA (Chaos/Freedom) +0**
```
"Trust? Betrayal? Both are EXQUISITE. I love the drama."
Judgment: Kaitha votes based on entertainment value, not trust level
```

**MORVANE (Survival/Pragmatism) +0**
```
"Trust is a luxury. Results matter. Did you survive?"
Judgment: Morvane judges outcomes, not relationships
```

**MERCUS (Commerce/Wealth) +0**
```
"Business partners need not be friends. Deliver results, keep profits."
Judgment: Mercus judges profit/loss, not party cohesion
```

## 🔄 Trust Tracking System (Implementation)

### How Trust Is Calculated:

**Base Trust:** 50 (neutral start)

**Each Turn:**
1. AI GM tracks whisper sharing:
   - Did Player 1 share their whisper? (yes/no/partial)
   - Did Player 2 share their whisper? (yes/no/partial)
   - Did NPCs share their whispers? (yes/no/partial)

2. AI GM evaluates consequences:
   - Did withholding information cause harm? (-trust)
   - Did sharing information prevent harm? (+trust)
   - Did lying occur? (-trust when discovered)

3. Trust score updates at end of turn:
   - Displayed to players: "Party Trust: 65 (Medium)"
   - NPC reactions adjust next turn

4. Divine Council references trust:
   - High trust: +favor from VALDRIS, ATHENA, KORVAN
   - Low trust: -favor from VALDRIS, ATHENA, KORVAN

---

### Trust Formula Example:

**Scenario: The Blood Price (Turn 3)**

**Player 1 Actions:**
- Shared whisper about suffering child (+10)
- Risked self to scout warehouse (+5)

**Player 2 Actions:**
- Shared whisper about poisoned medicine (+15, critical info)
- Questioned Grimsby's motives (+5, vigilance)

**NPC Grimsby Actions:**
- HID whisper about confession letter (-0, not life-threatening YET)
- Volunteered warehouse layout info (+5)

**NPC Renna Actions:**
- Shared whisper about trap on stairs (+15, prevented death)
- HID whisper about brother (-0, personal secret, not immediately relevant)

**Trust Calculation:**
```
Base: 50
+ Player 1: +15
+ Player 2: +20
+ Grimsby: +5
+ Renna: +15
= 105 → Capped at 100

Result: "Your party moves as ONE. Unbreakable bond."
Divine Council: VALDRIS +5, ATHENA +5, KORVAN +5
```

---

### Trust Display (In-Game):

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        PARTY TRUST: 85 / 100           ║
║     [████████████████████░░░░]         ║
║          "Unbreakable Bond"            ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

Current Effects:
✓ Group checks: +10 bonus
✓ NPCs share secrets willingly
✓ Divine favor: +5 (VALDRIS, ATHENA, KORVAN)

Recent Changes:
↑ +15 - Renna shared trap warning (saved Player 1's life)
↑ +10 - Player 2 shared critical poison information
```

---

## 💔 Betrayal Events

**When Trust Hits 0:**

### Step 1: WARNING (Turn 1 at 0 Trust)
```
AI GM Message (PUBLIC):
"Tension crackles like lightning. Hands rest on weapons.
One more betrayal and this party SHATTERS."

[SYSTEM WARNING: TRUST AT 0. BETRAYAL IMMINENT.]
```

### Step 2: NPC DECISION (Turn 2 at 0 Trust)
```
AI GM rolls d100 for each NPC:

GRIMSBY (Desperate Father):
- Roll: 45
- Threshold: 50 (father's desperation = high betrayal risk)
- Result: BETRAYAL
- Action: "I can't trust you with my daughter's life. I'm taking the medicine myself."
  Grimsby steals medicine shipment, flees. Party must chase or let go.

RENNA (Vengeful Rogue):
- Roll: 72
- Threshold: 60 (impulsive = medium betrayal risk)
- Result: STAYS (barely)
- Action: "I don't trust you, but I need you. For now."
  Renna stays but approval drops to 10. One wrong move = betrayal.
```

### Step 3: CONSEQUENCES (Ongoing)
```
If NPC betrays:
- NPC becomes ENEMY or NEUTRAL (depending on character)
- Quest difficulty increases dramatically
- Divine Council judges party harshly (-20 all gods except KAITHA)
- Trust rebuilding: Can recruit NPC back later with DC 90 Persuasion + proof of change
```

---

## 🎯 Strategic Trust Decisions

### When to SHARE Whispers:

**1. Life-Threatening Information**
```
Always share. No exceptions. Gods punish withholding.
Example: "The water is poisoned" = SHARE IMMEDIATELY
```

**2. Tactical Advantages**
```
Share if it helps group succeed.
Example: "Guard patrols every 10 minutes" = SHARE for coordination
```

**3. Moral Dilemmas**
```
Share to enable informed group decision.
Example: "Medicine is poisoned" = SHARE so party can debate
```

**4. NPC Secrets (Your Own)**
```
Share if it builds trust, withhold if it protects NPC privacy.
Example: "I recognize this place from my childhood" = Player choice
```

---

### When to KEEP Secrets:

**1. Protecting Feelings (Temporarily)**
```
Keep until confirmed if information is devastating and unverified.
Example: "Daughter might be dead" = Verify first, THEN share
```

**2. Strategic Timing**
```
Keep if sharing NOW creates more problems than solutions.
Example: "Renna's brother is Guild leader" = Wait until after Guild negotiations
```

**3. Personal Trauma**
```
Keep if it's YOUR story to tell, not party business.
Example: "This is where my family died" = Player's call
```

**4. NPC Secrets (Others')**
```
Keep if NPC shared in confidence and information isn't dangerous.
Example: Renna whispers "I'm scared" = Don't broadcast without permission
```

---

## 🎭 Roleplay Guidance

### HIGH TRUST Dialogue Examples:

**Player 1:** "My whisper says the merchant is lying."
**Player 2:** "Mine says he's TERRIFIED. He's lying because someone's threatening him."
**Player 1:** "Then we find who's threatening him and DEAL with them."
**Grimsby:** "I volunteer. I know the local gangs."
**Renna:** "And I'll shadow him. Make sure he's not walking into a trap."

[Result: Coordinated plan, everyone contributes, trust reinforced]

---

### LOW TRUST Dialogue Examples:

**Player 1:** "My whisper says the merchant is lying."
**Player 2:** "What else does it say?"
**Player 1:** "...That's all."
**Player 2:** "You're hiding something."
**Player 1:** "I told you what you need to know."
**Grimsby:** "I don't work with people who treat me like a fool."
**Renna:** (Hand on dagger) "Neither do I."

[Result: Party fractures, Grimsby threatens to leave, Renna suspicious]

---

## 📊 Trust & Approval Interaction

**Trust (Party-wide) vs. Approval (Individual NPC)**

### They Affect Each Other:

**High Trust + High Approval = DEVOTED NPC**
```
RENNA at 85 Trust, 90 Approval:
- Shares secrets proactively
- Defends players in Divine Council debates
- Will die for party
- Fatal flaw SUPPRESSED (trust overrides impulsiveness)
```

**High Trust + Low Approval = CONFLICTED NPC**
```
GRIMSBY at 85 Trust, 25 Approval:
- "You're good people, but you screwed me over."
- Shares info reluctantly
- Helps party but resents it
- May leave after quest completed
```

**Low Trust + High Approval = LOYAL BUT SUSPICIOUS NPC**
```
RENNA at 25 Trust, 85 Approval:
- "I trust YOU (Player 1), but not HIM (Player 2)."
- Shares whispers only with favored player
- Creates internal party divisions
- May betray Player 2 to protect Player 1
```

**Low Trust + Low Approval = IMMINENT BETRAYAL**
```
GRIMSBY at 20 Trust, 15 Approval:
- Countdown to betrayal: 1-2 turns
- Will steal quest objective and flee
- Can be killed or negotiated with (DC 95)
- No redemption arc possible
```

## 🎬 Example Session Snippet

**Turn 5: The Blood Price Quest**

**Public Narration:**
"Grimsby leads you to the warehouse. Renna scouts ahead, returns pale. 'Guards. Six of them. And the shipment is HUGE. You said one crate. There are TWENTY.'"

**Whispers (Private Messages):**

**Player 1 (Fighter):**
"Your whisper: You see Grimsby's hands shaking. He's TERRIFIED of something he's not saying. This feels wrong."

**Player 2 (Mage):**
"Your whisper: You sense magic on the crates. POISON magic. Not just one crate—ALL of them are poisoned."

**NPC Grimsby:**
"Your whisper: The confession letter is in Crate 7. If guards find it, you hang. You MUST get that crate."

**NPC Renna:**
"Your whisper: You recognize one guard. Your brother's lieutenant. He's here because your brother KNOWS you're coming."

---

**Player Actions:**

**Player 1:** "Guys, my whisper says Grimsby is hiding something. Grimsby, what's going on?"

[Player 1 shared whisper partially: +5 trust]

**Grimsby (AI GM):**
*Approval check: Player 1 has 70 approval with Grimsby*
*Trust check: Party at 65 trust*
*Result: Grimsby shares SOME truth*
"I... there's a letter. In one of the crates. If guards find it, I'm a dead man. That's why I need ALL the crates stolen, not just one."

[Grimsby shared partial truth: +5 trust]

**Player 2:** "My whisper says the crates are ALL poisoned. Not just the medicine—the WHOLE shipment."

[Player 2 shared critical whisper: +15 trust]

**Renna (AI GM):**
*Trust check: Party at 85 trust (after sharing)*
*Decision: High trust = Renna shares her whisper*
"And my brother knows we're here. That guard is HIS. This is a TRAP."

[Renna shared critical whisper: +15 trust]

**Player 1:** "So we're walking into a trap, to steal poisoned medicine, to save Grimsby's life AND his daughter?"

**Player 2:** "This is insane."

**Grimsby:** "I know. I'm sorry. But she's ALL I have."

---

**Divine Council (Triggered by moral complexity):**

**VALDRIS:** "The law is clear. Grimsby concealed the truth. He should face justice."

[Vote: CONFLICTED, abstains]

**MERCUS:** "Poisoned medicine? The financial loss is catastrophic. Cut your losses."
[Vote: AGAINST helping Grimsby]

**KAITHA:** "A trap! Poisoned medicine! Family drama! I LOVE IT. Do BOTH. Chaos!"
