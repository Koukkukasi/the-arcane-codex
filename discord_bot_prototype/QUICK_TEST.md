# QUICK TEST GUIDE
**Test Discord Bot in 2 Minutes**

---

## ⚡ FASTEST PATH TO TESTING

### Option 1: Test with 1 Account (Solo)
```bash
cd C:\Users\ilmiv\ProjectArgent\discord_bot_prototype
python discord_bot.py
```

**In Discord:**
```
!start
!join Theron Fighter
!begin
```

**Check your DMs** for Fighter's private whisper!

```
!action I flip the table for cover
```

Bot resolves turn, sends new whispers.

### Option 2: Test with 3 Accounts (Full Experience)

**Need:**
- Your main Discord account
- 2 friend accounts OR 2 Discord alts

**Steps:**
1. All 3 join your test server
2. One person: `!start`
3. Each person: `!join <name> <class>`
4. Leader: `!begin`
5. **Check each person's DMs - they're ALL DIFFERENT!**

This shows the asymmetric whispers in action!
