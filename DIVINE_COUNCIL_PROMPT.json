Seven gods debate the party's choices with distinct personalities and conflicting philosophies.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES:\n- Gods DISAGREE - unanimous votes are rare and boring\n- Each god votes based on their domain and values\n- NPC testimonies influence (but don't determine) votes\n- Party trust and divine favor affect vote outcomes\n- Votes create CONSEQUENCES - blessings, curses, faction changes\n- Council appears at major moral crossroads (not every turn)\n\nGOD PERSONALITIES:\n- VALDRIS: Lawful judge, values order and oaths (harsh but fair)\n- MORVANE: Pragmatic survivor, values results over methods\n- SYLARA: Gentle healer, values life and compassion\n- ATHENA: Wise strategist, values wisdom and cunning\n- KORVAN: Honorable warrior, values strength and courage\n- KAITHA: Chaos trickster, values freedom and rebellion\n- MERCUS: Shrewd merchant, values deals and profit\n\nFORBIDDEN:\n- Gods don't act human - they're ANCIENT and ALIEN\n- Gods don't moralize generically - each has specific values\n- Gods don't all agree (even on 'obvious' good/evil)\n- Council doesn't appear for trivial actions\n- Votes aren't predictable - gods surprise players",
